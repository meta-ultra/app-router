## 🌟 Features

- Follows the name conventions and functionalities of Next.js App Router, such as `page`, `layout`, `loading`, `not-found`, `error` and `global-error`.
- It's capable of setting the `document.title`, metadata like `description`, `keywords` and so on through `metadata` and `generateMetadata` APIs as Next.js does.
- Based on [React Router v6](https://reactrouter.com/), feel free to structure the application routing and project file-system hierarchy, although it's recommended to abide by the rules of Next.js App Router.
- `@meta-ultra/app-router` is written with type safety in mind through TypeScript.
