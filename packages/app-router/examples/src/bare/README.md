# Bare Example

This example demonstrates how to use `RouteSegmentElement` to construct routing with very basic features, including:

- Layouts and nested routes
- Index routes
- Using `children` for child routes instead of `<Outlet/>`
- Default not found handling provided by React Router
- Default global error handling provided by @meta-ultra/app-router
