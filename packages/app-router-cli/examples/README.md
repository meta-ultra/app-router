# Welcome to @meta-ultra/app-router Examples

Here you'll find various examples of using @meta-ultra/app-router to accomplish certain tasks. Each example is a independent portion which includes its own routing configuration, therefore it's free to navigate to different examples after springing up by changing the URL.

Also, remember to check out the README!

Enjoy!

## Setup

1. Navigate to the parent folder, and install all dependencies for `@meta-ultra/app-router` to ensure examples using the same instance with source code.
2. Go back to this folder, and install all dependencies for examples.
3. Run `pnpm dev` in this folder to spring up a Webpack dev server.

It's time to explore!
